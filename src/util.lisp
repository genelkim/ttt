; ones starting this way, which we may want to use in some patterns
; (e.g., in wff-patterns involving *, **, @, or ~), but can't
; because of their special meanings in TTT. We're assuming that
; the wffs we want to process don't *already* contain symbols in
; square brackets, starting as above inside the brackets, and which
; shouldn't have the brackets removed when we ultimately "unhide"
; the hidden symbols in a formula.
;
; The optional all-pkg argument allows full control of the package
; in which the symbols are interned. Otherwise, the function defaults
; to the home package of each symbol. Due to symbol inheritence, the
; default functionality may not always work.
