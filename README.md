My personal copy of the TTT library.

This is the library originally written by Adam Purtee, accompanied by the paper 
[TTT: A tree transduction language for syntactic and semantic processing](http://aclweb.org/anthology/W12-0803).
I have this local copy since I may make small modifications to make the code work in different environments.
